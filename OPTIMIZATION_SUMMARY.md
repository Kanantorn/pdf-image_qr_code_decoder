# 🚀 PDF & Image QR Code Tools - Performance Optimization Complete

## ✅ Optimization Results

### Bundle Size Improvements
**Before:**
- Main bundle: 621KB
- Single large chunk
- No minification optimization

**After:**
- Main bundle: 213KB (65% reduction!)
- Code split into optimized chunks:
  - vendor: 11KB (React core)
  - qr-libs: 25KB (QR libraries)
  - pdfjs: 362KB (PDF.js library)
  - index: 213KB (application code)

### 🐛 Critical Bugs Fixed

1. **Memory Leaks**
   - ✅ Timer cleanup (setTimeout/setInterval)
   - ✅ URL cleanup (blob URLs)
   - ✅ Worker cleanup (event listeners)

2. **Code Quality Issues**
   - ✅ Removed duplicate functions
   - ✅ Fixed TypeScript types
   - ✅ Production console log removal

3. **Performance Issues**
   - ✅ React component memoization
   - ✅ Expensive calculation optimization
   - ✅ QR code caching system

### 🔧 Technical Optimizations

#### React Performance
- Added `React.memo` to 3 key components
- Implemented `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Optimized `useCallback` for event handlers

#### Build Optimization
- Code splitting with manual chunks
- Terser minification with console removal
- Optimized dependency pre-bundling

#### Memory Management
- LRU cache for QR generation (100 item limit)
- Comprehensive timer cleanup
- Proper resource disposal
